# Threat Hunting and DNS Overview

# Starting from 10-02-2023

### DNS Overview
The **Domain Name System (DNS)** translates domain names into IP addresses, making internet navigation easier.
- **Example:** `iub.edu.bd` resolves to its corresponding IP address.
- **Internet Flow:** [Upstream â†’ IAG â†’ ISP]
- Most upstream connections in Bangladesh route through **Singapore**, leading to **lower latency** due to proximity.

### DNS Basics
- The home router serves as a **recursive DNS server**.
- Accessing `iub.edu.bd` requires resolving its IP address.
- **Caching:** Stores data temporarily for faster retrieval.
- **Root DNS Servers:** The world has **13 root DNS servers**.
- **TLD & ccTLD:** Manage top-level and country-specific domains.
- Before DNS, `robots.txt` maintained all IP mappings.

### Notable Events
- **2021 Akamai Outage:** A major CDN provider failure disrupted global access.
- **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol):** Essential for inter-data center connectivity; disabling BGP can bring networks down.
- **IUB's DNS Server:** Hosts one DNS server internally.

### DNS and Security
- **Google DNS Server:** `8.8.8.8`
- **DDoS Attacks via Open DNS:** Attackers often exploit open DNS servers.
- **Protocols:**
  - **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** Connection-oriented.
  - **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):** Connectionless, often used for fast data transfer.
  - **DNS Port:** `53`

### Understanding RFC
Before learning DNS technology, read **RFC (Request for Comments)**, which acts as the **user manual** or **man page**.

### DNS Hierarchy & Resolution
- **Parent of DNS:** ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers).
- **TLD Example:** `.edu.bd`
- Querying `dig iub.edu.bd` twice can help trace the lookup process.

### DNS Components
- **IP Anycast:** A Cisco-invented technology that routes users to the closest server.
- If a domain lacks a valid IP, its emails may end up in spam.

### Resource Records (RRs) in a Zone File
- If `ns1.apnic.net` is modified, update the **serial number manually**.
- **Example:** Serial `2020072002` â†’ `2020072003` after an update.
- **Refresh Value:** `7200`

### Delegating a Zone
- **Command:** `dig apnic.net +trace`
- **Cybersecurity Focus:** Be prepared to act as both a **DNS attacker** and **defender**.

### Checking DNS Information
- **Command:** `dig iub.edu.bd ANY`
- **IUB's DNS Servers:** 2 authoritative DNS servers.

### DNS Software
- **BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain):** Popular DNS server software.
- **Configuration Files:** `.conf` files manage DNS settings.
- To **prevent recursive queries** from localhost, configure settings carefully.

### Zones in a Recursive Server
- **Example IPs:** `192.168.100.99` & `100.168.192`

### Security Best Practices
- **Always keep yourself updated** on security trends.
- **Failure isn't a barrier; it's a learning step.**
- **DNS Tunneling:** A common offensive technique in cybersecurity.

### Zone Transfers (AXFR & IXFR)
- **AXFR (Full Zone Transfer):** Transfers the entire DNS zone.
- **IXFR (Incremental Zone Transfer):** Transfers only changes.

### Best Practices for DNS Hosting
- **Separate Recursive & Authoritative Servers:** 
  - Avoid hosting both on the **same server**.
  - Keep them on **different Linux OS instances**.
  - Follow the **single-service-per-host** principle.

### Network Fundamentals
- **Routers operate at the Data Link Layer**.
- Understanding **OSI Model layers** is crucial for networking.
- **Slide presentations** contain valuable diagramsâ€”review them carefully.
