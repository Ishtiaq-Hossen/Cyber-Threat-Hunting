#Historic Overview of threat hunting
	crop start
		movie of dr stange on ww2 -> need to see
		book-> sanju the art of war
	crop end
Agenda 
1. Concepts of network
2. Dns ecosystem
3. Cyber security 
4. Threat analytics & hunting

"Don't believe everything you read on the Internet"
-Ab Lincoln

================

WAN-> wide area Network
MAN-> Metropliton Area Network
Lan->has 3 block 192.168.10.10
->OTT,neflix 
public ip

WAN has MAN
MAN has LAN

IPV4-> Asia te sesh
IPV6-> 

What is network?
key: Hob ,latency,browsing slow

#Cyber! What was the origin of it?
	Cyber->1950
	Cyber space ->1990
		->digital device gula interconnect howar obosta
Note: learning system->(term->origin)

#Cyberspace consists of four components 
-information 
-physical
-cognitive actions
-people
bottom to top

==>war is collective form of crime
crime started ->1950s
Mr BOB made creeper,rev thought to catch it  but made a virus surprisingly 
-> ager pc te chilo->robot.txt

[ip taake easy korar jonno ahslo dns 
namer representation easy korse]
[Dns came with a solution,it easier than ip
it give's easiness in name representation]


.com holo 1st tld

kespersky copied clan patent

Cyber security ->buisnessmodel, politics etc started from 1990
Cyber attack name: SQL injection,cross site ,remote ,dataclip,zeroday attack
	zero day means don't know
	full info expose na kora publicly 
apple icloud breaches 
keyword: dirty cow 

what is security ?

Cyber security has 3 basic part:
->C=(Confidentiality)-> question fash
->I=Integrity 
	East west university 
	->student ra hack korse
	->9 mash pore khobor hoise ewu ->Integrity

->A=Availability 
	max victim company cut wire for reducing vulnerability

apni je service ta dite caccen ta koto tuku avaible for your client 

[spices reduce corona in bd]=>jokes apart sometimes bad things comes with good outcome 

top 5 attack
->Micro 
->facebook
->linkdin
->lindin
->accenture
->acer

security is a myth
Once you connected with the internet you aren't secure
Someone from FBI said -> 
People didn't think that they need cyber security ,once they became victim of any cyber attack 
they feel it.
#manush jotokkon na cyber attack e pore totokkon mne porena cyber security dorkar

=========================================
Acceidental 
-something happen accidently
Intentionally 
-nsu programmers did hack their mail for anoynimous mail
 that can reduce nsu respect 
=====================================
#DNS tunelling
vimwire -> laptop aro koyekta server diye dewa hocce

============================
Door lock aren't working->vulnerablility 
For checking I put key on that-> vulnerability assesment 
After servicing the door I will check that the door is locked/not=>penetration testing [attack perform kore test kore dekbo]

================================
annominity-> koyta girlfriend ase 
billgates 256 character er password dise and setao breakdown hoise 
->billgates vabsilo eta breakdown pssible na
=================================

Cyberspace-> all things that are connected with digital life
=================================
#Threat x attack

#Cyber security ! framework

==============================
Suggesions: we need to study on cyber security all the time 

Ginipeg amader banano hoi ,as we all are chatgpt user

Getting started with Cyer Security 
-Coding 
-Systems 
-Applications
-Networking 
Hack hoi windows breach hoi linux e 
=======================
web server koto doroner ase ,vulberability ki 
etc 
Socket =ip+port 
8080 ke ip diye bind kore dicci ,etai socket 

=======================
Getting started 
-CampTia

	Attack life cycle 
	Security tools and meeasures 
	=================
	Nmap 
	-nmap -sS <meta2_IP>
	

	ls | wc -l
	ls -l |wc -l
	wc -l snmp_short-
	snmp walk -c prlv4


wc -l ssh-usernames.txt
it will show something like 55 ssh-usernames.txt




=================================

own note
what does
ll /
list the root directory 
all the system files
os files,app,doc,except user data
user data -> home
ll /usr
ll /usr/local 
both of the hierarchy is for read only file

both will show same because both has same purpose 
usr are there is for some historical reasons

 
ll /var     

to see linux version==> lsb_release -a
to see crontab is install or not: crontab -l
			or crontab -e
